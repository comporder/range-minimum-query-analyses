# Range Minimum Query (RMQ): Algorithms and Experimental Analysis

This project explores various algorithms used to solve the Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem. Implemented in Java, it includes both theoretical and experimental analysis of four major techniques:

- Precompute All
- Sparse Table
- Blocking
- Precompute None

The project investigates the performance of each algorithm under different dataset sizes and query counts, offering practical insights into when and where each method is most suitable.
